Impressive Performance and Stunning Camera QualityReviewed in India on 3 January 2024Iâ€™ve been using the iPhone 13 for the past 3-4 months, and I am thoroughly impressed with its overall performance. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and lag-free operation, making multitasking a breeze.The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The Night mode improvements are noticeable, delivering clear and sharp images even in low-light environments. The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content.The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting a full day with moderate usage. The 120Hz ProMotion display contributes to a silky-smooth experience, enhancing gaming and video playback.The design is sleek and feels premium, while the Ceramic Shield front provides added durability. The introduction of 5G connectivity ensures fast data speeds, enhancing the overall user experience.While the absence of a charger and earphones might be a drawback for some, the iPhone 13â€™s performance, camera capabilities, and design make it a worthwhile upgrade. Highly recommended for those seeking a top-tier smartphone experience.
Good phone But afraid of UpdatesReviewed in India on 20 October 20237 Days used review . The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .Coming to phoneIOS 16.6 (current not updated)- it was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .Display- The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before.- The brightness Range is so comfortable.- The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experianceBattery And charging- The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge  from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter without any interruption- Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on time- Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issuePerfomance- Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer )Camera- The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode .- Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me.- The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good
Product was received in good condition and no glitches or problems
Mobile got over heat automatically and turned off. And it is not working. Worst product. Even when it's working, it will hang automatically.
